This was a nice lab that tested my ability with wireshark by:
Finding the attackers user agent by examining the http requests made by the attacker

Finding the webshell used by the attacker and verifying it was successful by investigating HTTP POST packets and following the HTTP stream, looking for a 200 from the server after the upload attempt
To track down the directory used by the attacker to store the uploaded files by filtering by the file name
lastly discovering the port used in the attack and the file the attacker attempted to exfiltrate
